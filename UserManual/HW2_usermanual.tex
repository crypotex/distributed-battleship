\section*{Setup process and dependencies}
Firstly, the (middleware) dependencies are pika python library and RabbitMQ.

To run the application, first server needs to be run. To do this run file "server.py" from the command line. That should set up the server.

Once the server is running, client user interfaces can be opened by running "gui.py" from the command line.
